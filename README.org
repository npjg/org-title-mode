This package provides semantic naming for Org buffers. `org-title-mode', its
namesake minor mode, sets the name of an Org buffer to the title of the Org
document, with appropriate conflict resolution policies in place. When the mode
is disabled, the name of the buffer is restored to what it was before the mode
renamed it.
