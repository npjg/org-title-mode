#+TITLE: org-title-mode

This package provides semantic naming for Org buffers. =org-title-mode=, its
namesake minor mode, sets the name of an Org buffer to the title of the Org
document, with appropriate conflict resolution policies in place. The default
text category is also changed from the file name sans extension to the
document's title. When the mode is disabled, the name of the buffer is restored
to what it was before the mode renamed it.
